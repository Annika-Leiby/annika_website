## Interests

I first became interested in water resource issues from frequent visits to the Chesapeake Bay as a kid. I carried on this interest through my undergraduate education at Lafayette College  where I studied Geology and Environmental Studies. I ultimately decided that I wanted to pursue a Masters degree so I packed my bags, moved across the country, and am now finishing up my degree at the Bren School at the University of Califorrnia, Santa Barbara.

## Experience

At the Bren School I am specializing in water resources and getting a focus in data science. My master's project is for the CA Department of Water Resources and Environmental Defense Fund and my team is using geospatial modeling to find locations in Madera County, CA where multi benefit flood managed aquifer recharge projects can be implemented for the purpose of recharging gorundwater, enhancing ecosystems, and reducing flood risk. 


At Bren, I am also a Sustainable Water Market (SWM) fellow. As part of the program I participate in specialized classes and seminars related to water markets in the western United States. This past summer I held a part time internship with Clean Water Action in Baltimore, MD as well as a part time research position at the Bren school where I gathered international water level data.
